# jsgn-schema

This repository contains several [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) definitions which together define the [JavaScript Graph Notation (JSGN)](https://github.com/JavaScriptGraphNotation) format which is meant to allow flexibly storing graph data as [JSON](http://www.json.org/). In terms of expressivity the approach taken here is pivotally inspired by the [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/index.html) format and compatibility with GraphML is one primary goal. There are no formal garantuees though.

See [here](https://github.com/JavaScriptGraphNotation/jsgn-schema/blob/concept/jsgn.pdf) for a formal description what kind of graphs can be represented with JSGN and GraphML.
