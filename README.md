# jsgn-schema

This repository contains several [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) definitions which together define the [JavaScript Graph Notation (JSGN)](https://github.com/JavaScriptGraphNotation) format which is meant to allow flexibly storing graph data as [JSON](http://www.json.org/). In terms expressivity the approach taken here is pivotally inspired by the [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/index.html) format.

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
